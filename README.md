# Nobel-Coaching-and-Tutoring-Projects-2020

These websites were created during the first year of my Web Design and Development Internship at Nobel Coaching and Tutoring. I worked with teams to develop and design these websites using Wordpress, Elementor, HTML, and CSS. 

The first website, High School Unlocked, is a project I worked on with a small group of 4-5 to experiment with and learn how to use Wordpress and Elementor. As high school students, we wanted to help other high schoolers navigate their academic, extracurricular, and career goals by providing informative advice and guidance in a creative and fun way. 

The second website, Gen01 Interns, is a project I worked on with all of the 10-12 fellow interns at Nobel to share our experiences as the first generation of interns at Nobel Coaching and Tutoring. We demonstrate what we learned both through the development and design of the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootsrap, as well as testimonials and showcases in the content of the website itself. We aimed to inspire other students to be a part of Nobel Coaching and Tutoring to benefit from and contribute to a global community of tech learners and creators.
